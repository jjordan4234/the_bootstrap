Write code to simulate this process, and determine its expected value using the law of large numbers. What is the probability of getting a total of 1, 2, 3, ... and so on, in your simulation?

    "**Q4.** The goal of the question is to incorporate features/covariates/predictors/explanatory variables into the kind of treatment effect comparisons done in the previous questions. This question refers to the `heart_hw.csv` data. It contains three variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `y`: Whether the individual survived, coded 0 for death and 1 for survival\n",
    "  - `age`: Patient's age\n",
    "  - `transplant`: `control` for not receiving a transplant and `treatment` for receiving a transplant\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute (a) the proportion of people who survive in the control group who do not receive a transplant, and (b) the difference between the proportion of people who survive in the treatment group and the proportion of people who survive in the control group (the average treatment effect).\n",
    "2. Regress `y` on `transplant` using a linear model. How does the constant/intercept of the regression and the coefficient on transplant compare to your answers from part 1? Explain carefully.\n",
    "3. We'd like to include `age` in the regression, since it's reasonable to expect that older patients are less likely to survive an extensive surgery like a heart transplant. Regress `y` on transplant, age, and transplant $\\times$ age. You can do this using a linear regression. How do the intercept and the coefficient on `transplanttreatment` change?\n",
    "4. Build a more flexible model that allows for non-linear age effects and interactions between age and treatment. Estimate the model, and plot the predicted survival probability by age, hued for people who receive a heart transplant and those who don't. Describe what you see.\n",
    "5. Imagine someone suggests using these kinds of models to select who receives organ transplants; perhaps the CDC or NIH starts using a scoring algorithm to decide who is contacted about a potential organ transplant. What are your concerns about how it is built and how it is deployed?"
